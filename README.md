# Calculus-Cheat-Sheet

Distributing my Calculus Cheat Sheets.  
Since dispite having wrote most of the LaTeX obviously the contents on it came from lots of different sources (classes I attend for example), I take no credit for the contents of the pages. Anyway, please let me know if you find any mistakes on them or if you have any suggestions on something I should add.  

### Calculus I
Was checked and should not have any mistakes. Should be completed and usable. As I get some free time I might translate it to english.

### Calculus II
Still writing most of it. After it is completed and checked I might translate it to english.
