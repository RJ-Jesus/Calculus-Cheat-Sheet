# Calculus-Cheat-Sheet

Distributing my Calculus Cheat Sheets.  
Since dispite having wrote most of the LaTeX obviously the contents on it came from lots of different sources (classes I attend for example), I take no credit for the contents of the pages. Anyway, please let me know if you find any mistakes on them or if you have any suggestions on something I should add.  

### Calculus I
Was checked and should be mistakes free. Should be completed and usable.  
As I get some free time I might translate it to english.

### Calculus II
~~Still writing most of it. Half way through. Next big update should come by the end of this term.~~ Although not yet checked, it should be completed. As I get some free time I might translate it to english, much like Calculus I sheet.

Thanks to FÃ¡bio Maia got some pretty dumb typos fixed. Thanks.
