# Calculus-Cheat-Sheet

Distributing my Calculus Cheat Sheets.  
Since dispite having wrote most of the LaTeX obviously the contents on it came from lots of different sources (classes I attend for example), I take no credit for the contents of the pages. Anyway, please let me know if you find any mistakes on them or if you have any suggestions on something I should add.  
After having helped me correcting some typos, Fábio Maia has now been helping me translating and making this more publicly visible, and thus is a "full member" of this project. Thanks once again.  

### Calculus I
Was checked and should be mistakes free. Should be completed and usable.  
As I get some free time I might translate it to english.

### Calculus II

Calculus II cheat sheet is completed and translated to english (although not yet publicly available).
